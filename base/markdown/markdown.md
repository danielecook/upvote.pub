# What is markdown?

<br />

See Mark Gruber's [daringfireball.net](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for a full explanation. He lists the following definition on his site:

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

# Available markdown
<br />
In submitted comments you can use markdown to format your posts. Not all markdown elements are available. The following elements are allowed.


<table class='table'>
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Plain Text</th>
        <th>Markdown</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <pre>

            </pre>
        </td>
        <td>
            <div markdown='1'>
            # h1
            </div>
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody>

</table>
